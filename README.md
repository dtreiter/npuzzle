# N-Puzzle

This is N-Puzzle, a work-in-progress remake of the classic 15 Puzzle game.
Although it doesn't have UI controls for it yet, the puzzle can be configured to
be any size.

My motivation for making this is to add a 'blind mode', requiring solving the
puzzle from memory.

You can play the game [here](http://danielreiter.org/npuzzle).
